# NonstationaryProcesses.jl
Generate nonstationary time series by varying the parameters of otherwise stationary processes

[This](src/Processes.jl) file contains functions that handle calls to DifferentialEquations.jl as well as variables specifying default parameters and solvers. Run `using DifferentialEquations` to load the processes.
